# Hidden Div Bug
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML where a div element is hidden using JavaScript, but there's no mechanism provided in the code to make it visible again.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficulty in debugging if not carefully considered.

## Bug Description
A div element is hidden immediately upon page load by setting its `display` style property to "none". There is no other JavaScript code or user interaction that would re-display this div.

## Solution
The solution involves adding a mechanism to control the visibility of the div. This can include a button or a change in other JavaScript states. This would allow a toggle or other function to make it visible again.
